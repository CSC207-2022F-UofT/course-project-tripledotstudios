# CSC207 Project: Lost-the Game

As of Nov. 28, we have finished most of our features for the game. We just need to finish the UI and one small feature 
between the CombatInteractor class and the StorylineInteractor class. After these implementations, our program will 
be able to run. 

## Progress Report
- [X] Sound feature during the game
- [X] Log in feature
- [X] Saving feature
- [X] Event demos
- [X] Item Pool and Data features
- [X] HP and Attack System in the game
- [X] Dialogue options and storyline interactions
- [X] Player data classes and interactors
- [X] UI

## How to Run the game
Run the main program
 
## Testing and Functionality

Since we cannot fully run our game right now, we have individually written tests for our code and tested it before
submitting the pull requests and merging.


## Design Patterns

In our CRC model, we already separated our classes into the different layers of Clean Architecture, so during
implementation, we did not have issues with adhering to Clean Architecture and the SOLID design rules. Putting our data 
classes into the entities layer and the interactors into the Use Case layer helped us not run into instances of breaking
Clean Architecture.
